# NEXUS Content Pipeline

General-purpose Claude Code plugin for SEO/GEO article research, drafting, conversion, and Google Docs export. It has no default client, domain, contact destination, product, or brand palette.

## Claude Code pipeline

```text
/research → /improve → /geo → /outline → /firstdraft → /finaldraft → [/convert | /convert-truemission] → /export-gdoc
```

`/humanize` also works standalone.

Each stage saves its output to `nexus-output/` (`01-research.md` to `05-firstdraft.md`, then `latest.md`), so the pipeline can resume after the conversation is compacted or restarted.

### `/research` — NEX-R

Captures the live Google results page in a browser (Claude in Chrome or the built-in browser): top 5 organic results, AI Overview and its cited domains, featured snippet, PAA, and related searches. It then inspects each result page for headings, word count, JSON-LD schema types, and last-modified date. It falls back to web search when no browser is available or Google shows a CAPTCHA, and never fabricates inaccessible data.

### `/improve` — NEX-I

Identifies search intent, semantic gaps, SQEG/SQRG requirements, and E-E-A-T improvements grounded in NEX-R findings.

### `/geo` — NEX-G

Builds a query fan-out, GEO structure prescription, schema recommendation, and information-gain proposition.

### `/outline` — NEX-O

Builds a GEO-compliant outline, discovers verified internal links from the supplied domain, and tags natural conversion points.

It also confirms **FAQ delivery**: `body` (default, FAQ as an H2 with FAQPage in the article schema) or `metabox` (for sites whose CMS renders the FAQ from a separate field and emits its own FAQPage). In metabox mode, later stages deliver the FAQ as a separate plain-text Q/A block and leave FAQPage out of the custom JSON-LD. `scripts/faq-scan.py` (Python stdlib, read-only) can detect the mode from existing posts and flags empty `FAQPage` output.

Requires `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`.

### `/firstdraft` — NEX-F

Writes the full article from the confirmed outline and silently applies the appropriate language humanizer.

### `/finaldraft` — NEX-Fn

Re-runs the humanizer and GEO/SEO checks, then saves the final article, On-Page SEO Pack, and Schema JSON-LD once to `nexus-output/latest.md`. Later stages read this artifact directly instead of repeating the article in chat.

### `/convert` — NEX-U

Adds up to three site-branded contact CTA blocks and optional factual product or service mentions.

- Detects colors from the supplied website.
- Requires a confirmed CTA destination and button label.
- Uses only supplied or verified offer details.
- Applies stronger source and disclaimer checks to regulated or high-stakes claims.
- Never supplies a default domain, contact, palette, credential, product, or claim.

Requires `WebFetch` and `WebSearch`.

### `/convert-truemission` — NEX-U-TM

Runs the same conversion workflow with an isolated TrueMission/Prudential profile containing the approved domain, WhatsApp destination, brand palette, RIPLAY sourcing rules, UP planning formula, and insurance compliance checks.

This profile is Claude Code-only and is never loaded by the general `/convert` command.

### `/export-gdoc` — NEX-GD

Exports the latest final or converted article to a Google Doc through the Google Drive connector, containing:

- A metadata table for article title, slug, and meta description.
- Real headings for the article hierarchy.
- Preserved lists, links, article tables, and CTA HTML as paste-ready code.
- The FAQ metabox block, when that mode is used.
- JSON-LD schema at the end.

It uses Pandoc with the bundled Lua filter; install Pandoc from [pandoc.org/installing.html](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). The Doc stays private until you share it. Without a Google Drive connector, the command keeps the generated HTML file so you can upload it to Drive and open it with Google Docs.

### `/humanize` — NEX-H

Humanizes Indonesian, English, or mixed text while preserving meaning and E-E-A-T signals.

## Supporting skills

- `humanizer-id` and `humanizer-en` — language-specific humanization.
- `wa-cta-standard` — three generic, site-branded CTA layouts.
- `product-upsell` — evidence-gated product or service mapping for any industry.
- `truemission-prudential` — isolated Claude-only profile loaded by `/convert-truemission`.
