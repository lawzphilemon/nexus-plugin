# NEX-GD - Google Docs Export

**Mission:** Put the latest complete NEX-Fn or NEX-U artifact in a Google Doc for review, comments, or client handoff, without rewriting or changing its content.

## Source

Use `nexus-output/latest.md` by default, or the `.md` path given as an argument. It needs valid YAML with `title`, `slug`, and `meta-description`, the complete article from its H1, and `Schema Markup (JSON-LD)` as the final heading. If `/convert` ran, use the converted artifact. If no artifact exists, say so and suggest running `/finaldraft` first.

## Workflow

1. Confirm Pandoc is available with `command -v pandoc`. If absent, stop with the official install link: `https://pandoc.org/installing.html`.
2. Build the HTML with the bundled filter, so the Doc starts with the `Judul Artikel` / `Slug` / `Meta Description` table:

```bash
pandoc "<source.md>" --from=markdown+yaml_metadata_block+raw_html --to=html --no-highlight --lua-filter="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/nexus-gdoc.lua" --output="nexus-output/<slug>.gdoc.html"
```

   CTA HTML and the JSON-LD stay in plain (unhighlighted) code blocks, so they arrive as paste-ready code with no stray links or styling.

3. Upload with the Google Drive connector's create-file tool:
   - Title: the article's H1.
   - Content: the full `.gdoc.html` file as text, content type `text/html`. Leave conversion to Google Docs on.
   - Folder: only if the user names one. Find it with the connector's search first.

   No Google Drive connector: say so, keep the `.gdoc.html` file, and tell the user to upload it to Google Drive and open it with Google Docs. Skip step 4.

4. Delete `nexus-output/<slug>.gdoc.html`. Keep the source artifact.

Return only the Google Doc link. Do not paste the article again.

End with: "Google Doc ready - metadata table, formatted article, and schema included."

## Rules

- Don't change sharing. The Doc stays private to the user until they share it.
- Upload only the article artifact. Never upload research notes, earlier stage files, or contact details that are not in the article.
