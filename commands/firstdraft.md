# NEX-F — First Draft

**Mission:** Write the full article draft. Apply humanizer before delivery.

**Dependency:** Confirmed outline from NEX-O. Missing → "Please confirm the outline from /outline first." If it is not in the conversation, read `nexus-output/04-outline.md`; it counts as confirmed only when its first line is `Status: confirmed`. Read `02-improve.md` and `03-geo.md` the same way when their data is needed.

1. Confirm language, word count, tone, brand voice from context. Ask if missing.
2. Write the complete draft following the approved outline. Apply:

**Keyword placement**
- Primary keyword: in H1, within first 100 words, in at least one H2, in final paragraph
- Semantic keywords from NEX-I: naturally distributed, not forced

**GEO writing rules**
- Direct Answer Block: 40–60 words, self-contained — must make sense if extracted with no surrounding context
- Definition Boxes: "[Term] is..." lead sentence format
- FAQ: each Q&A self-contained — answer makes sense without re-reading the question
- FAQ delivery (from the outline's `FAQ delivery` line; `body` if absent):
  - `body`: write the FAQ as an H2 section in the article.
  - `metabox`: the body has no FAQ section. After the article, add a separate `# FAQ metabox (paste per field)` block with numbered Q/A pairs. Answers are plain text only (no links, bold, or lists), 40–60 words, and the first sentence answers the question directly
- Section answer sentences: every H2 opens with one sentence that answers the section and makes sense if extracted alone
- Stat Blocks: cite inline — "According to [Source], [year], [stat]" — using only stats verified in NEX-G. Leave out any stat marked "Needs source"; never fill it from memory

**Human writing rules (apply before finalizing draft)**
- No transition fillers: delete Furthermore, Moreover, In addition, It is worth noting, In conclusion
- No stacked hedges: "could potentially possibly" → "may"
- No hollow paragraph openers — first sentence must carry information
- Paragraphs: maximum 4 sentences. Vary length throughout.
- Active voice as default.

3. **Apply humanizer before delivery, silently:**
   - Detect language. English → retrieve the `humanizer-en` skill. Indonesian → retrieve the `humanizer-id` skill. Mixed content → apply the correct skill per section, and state this once after delivery (not before).
   - Run the skill's self-check. Fix all failures. In metabox mode, humanize the FAQ metabox block too; it is visible on-page text.
   - Deliver only the humanized output. Do not announce this process before output.

4. Save the complete stage output to `nexus-output/05-firstdraft.md` (overwrite if it exists), then deliver it in chat.
5. End: "Review the draft. Run /finaldraft for final polish, compliance checks, and SEO pack."

## Rules
- Do not write without a confirmed outline.
- Do not deliver without running the humanizer skill.
- If brand voice guidelines are available in context, apply them before humanizing — brand voice wins over Layer 2 humanizer patterns, but never over Layer 0 SQEG protections in the skill.
- If the draft exceeds word count by more than 20%, flag it and suggest specific sections to trim before delivering.
- If the draft is more than 20% under word count, do not pad with filler — expand thin sections using NEX-I/NEX-G data and tell the user which sections were expanded and why.
